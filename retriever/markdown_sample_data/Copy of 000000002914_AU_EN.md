## Biological occupational exposure limits

No biological limit allocated.

## Monitoring Methods

Monitoring of the concentration of substances in the breathing zone of workers or in the general workplace may be required to confirm compliance with an OEL and adequacy of exposure controls. For some substances biological monitoring may also be appropriate.

Validated exposure measurement methods should be applied by a competent person and samples analysed by an accredited laboratory.

Examples of sources of recommended exposure measurement methods are given below or contact the supplier. Further national methods may be available.

National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), USA: Manual of Analytical Methods http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), USA: Sampling and Analytical Methods http://www.osha.gov/

## Engineering measures :

The level of protection and types of controls necessary will vary depending upon potential exposure conditions. Select controls based on a risk assessment of local circumstances. Appropriate measures include:

Adequate ventilation to control airborne concentrations. Where material is heated, sprayed or mist formed, there is greater potential for airborne concentrations to be generated. Eye washes and showers for emergency use.

## General Information

Always observe good personal hygiene measures, such as washing hands after handling the material and before eating, drinking, and/or smoking.  Routinely wash work clothing and protective equipment to remove contaminants.  Discard contaminated clothing and footwear that cannot be cleaned. Practice good housekeeping.

Define procedures for safe handling and maintenance of controls.

Educate and train workers in the hazards and control measures relevant to normal activities associated with this

## Personal protective equipment

## Protective measures

Personal protective equipment (PPE) should meet recommended national standards. Check with PPE suppliers.

<table><tbody><tr><td>Respiratory protection</td><td>:</td><td>If engineering controls do not maintain airborne concentrations to a level which is adequate to protect worker health, select respiratory protection equipment suitable for the specific conditions of use and meeting relevant legislation. Check with respiratory protective equipment suppliers. Where air-filtering respirators are unsuitable (e.g. airborne concentrations are high, risk of oxygen deficiency, confined space) use appropriate positive pressure breathing apparatus. Where air-filtering respirators are suitable, select an appropriate combination of mask and filter. If air-filtering respirators are suitable for conditions of use: Select a filter suitable for the combination of organic gases and vapours and particles [Type A/Type P boiling point &gt;65°C (149°F)].</td></tr><tr><th>Hand protection</th><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Remarks</td><td>:</td><td>Where hand contact with the product may occur the use of gloves approved to relevant standards (e.g. Europe: EN374, US: F739) made from the following materials may provide suitable chemical protection. Longer term protection: Nitrile rubber gloves. Incidental contact/Splash protection: PVC or neoprene rubber gloves. For continuous contact we recommend gloves with breakthrough time of more than 240 minutes with preference for &gt; 480 minutes where suitable gloves can be identified. For short-term/splash protection we recommend the same but recognize that suitable gloves offering this level of protection may not be available and in this case a lower breakthrough time maybe acceptable so long as appropriate maintenance and replacement regimes are followed. Glove thickness is not a good predictor of glove resistance to a chemical as it is dependent on the exact composition of the glove material. Glove thickness should be typically greater than 0.35 mm depending on the glove make and model. Suitability and durability of a glove is dependent on usage, e.g. frequency and duration of contact, chemical resistance of glove material, dexterity. Always seek advice from glove suppliers. Contaminated gloves should be replaced. Personal hygiene is a key element of effective hand</td></tr></tbody></table>
