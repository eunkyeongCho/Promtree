adequately by the engineering control measures. Ensure control measures are regularly
inspected and maintained. Ensure operatives are trained to minimise exposure.
Eye/face protection
Eyewear complying with an approved standard should be worn if a risk assessment indicates
eye contact is possible. Personal protective equipment for eye and face protection should
comply with European Standard EN166. Wear tight-fitting, chemical splash goggles or face
shield. If inhalation hazards exist, a full-face respirator may be required instead.
Hand protection
Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be worn if
a risk assessment indicates skin contact is possible. To protect hands from chemicals, gloves
should comply with European Standard EN374. Considering the data specified by the glove
manufacturer, check during use that the gloves are retaining their protective properties and
change them as soon as any deterioration is detected. Frequent changes are recommended.
It is recommended that gloves are made of the following material: Nitrile rubber. Butyl rubber.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Viton rubber (fluoro rubber). The selected gloves should have a
breakthrough time of at least 8 hours. Protective gloves should have a minimum thickness of
0.4 mm. The most suitable glove should be chosen in consultation with the glove
supplier/manufacturer, who can provide information about the breakthrough time of the glove
material.
Other skin and body
protection
Appropriate footwear and additional protective clothing complying with an approved standard
should be worn if a risk assessment indicates skin contamination is possible.
Hygiene measures
Provide eyewash station and safety shower. Contaminated work clothing should not be
allowed out of the workplace. Wash contaminated clothing before reuse. Clean equipment
and the work area every day. Good personal hygiene procedures should be implemented.
Wash at the end of each work shift and before eating, smoking and using the toilet. When
